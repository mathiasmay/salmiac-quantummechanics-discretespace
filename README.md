# salmiac-quantummechanics-discretespace
Program for quantum-mechanical calculations in discrete space

So far I uploaded a source-code-file from my diploma-thesis in quantum-physics to be able to link to it in my job applications.
One of my projects is to rework and further develop it and write a manual to make it easier to use and understand for other people. Until then the file will not be merged with the master branch.
